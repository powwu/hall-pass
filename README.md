# bathroom-pass

### A proof of concept for what my high school's online bathroom pass system should look like. 
Written in around 3 hours. Costs around $1100 less per year to use, plus $5500 less upfront cost. Also has increased student privacy, with only bare essentials included (because why should the school pick which bathroom I go to?)

**this is a very basic proof of concept, and is not intended to replace any existing hall pass system, as it lacks many basic features**
